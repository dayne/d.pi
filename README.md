Raspberry Pi Helper Stuff

This [Github](https://github.com) repo **d.pi** is to help track basic scripts and helper tools I've found online, hacked, or developed to support making [RaspberryPi](https://rpf.io) systems a bit more fun.

I'm using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dayne/d.pi/issues) to keep track of both a few future projects or problems I've found.  Feel free to use it to ask me questions about stuff.
